Hello guys, this is a simple blog web app made which supports markdown. 
This blog is made using
React.js in the frontend and Node, Express, and
MongoDB in the backend (MERN stack). I have used
tailwindCSS. I am not a big fan of UI libraries like
Bootstrap or Material UI. I prefer to use
TailwindCSS, because I have much more control over
the styling. TailwindCSS makes it easy and quick to
style your website.

This is writtend in markdown, but is parsed to HTML.
In this blog, I am going to give a little demo of this blog application.
